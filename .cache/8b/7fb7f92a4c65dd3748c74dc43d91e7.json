It has the\n * signature: `(part: Part) => void`.\n *\n * A directive _factory_ is a function that takes arguments for data and\n * configuration and returns a directive. Users of directive usually refer to\n * the directive factory as the directive. For example, \"The repeat directive\".\n *\n * Usually a template author will invoke a directive factory in their template\n * with relevant arguments, which will then return a directive function.\n *\n * Here's an example of using the `repeat()` directive factory that takes an\n * array and a function to render an item:\n *\n * ```js\n * html`<ul><${repeat(items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}</ul>`\n * ```\n *\n * When `repeat` is invoked, it returns a directive function that closes over\n * `items` and the template function. When the outer template is rendered, the\n * return directive function is called with the Part for the expression.\n * `repeat` then performs it's custom logic to render multiple items.\n *\n * @param f The directive factory function. Must be a function that returns a\n * function of the signature `(part: Part) => void`. The returned function will\n * be called with the part object.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * import {directive, html} from 'lit-html';\n *\n * const immutable = directive((v) => (part) => {\n *   if (part.value !== v) {\n *     part.setValue(v)\n *   }\n * });\n */\nexport const directive = <F extends DirectiveFactory>(f: F): F =>\n    ((...args: unknown[]) => {\n      const d = f(...args);\n      directives.set(d, true);\n      return d;\n    }) as F;\n\nexport const isDirective = (o: unknown): o is DirectiveFn => {\n  return typeof o === 'function' && directives.has(o);\n};\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"d82735990a0435cc73ef5133a0848105","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
